After working on many brands in the industry in\r\n                  India, we realized that there is so much confusion among\r\n                  customers in identifying what Natural, Herbal, and Organic are\r\n                  and their uses. Customers fail to notice the distinctions\r\n                  between these three categories due to their limited knowledge\r\n                  and they also seem to have lesser knowledge on extracts and\r\n                  actives.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  So, we thought it is really essential to come up with a brand\r\n                  that is transparent and uses only natural ingredients and\r\n                  also, we want to make details regarding the proportion of\r\n                  drugs we use very clear.{\" \"}\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  We are using Natural extracts but not only them; we are also\r\n                  using Actives that are clinically proven and have studies to\r\n                  support our claims regarding the effectiveness of our drug.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  With their wide knowledge and experience in Cosmetology and\r\n                  Pharmacy background, our directors have come up with the best\r\n                  products that have the right combination of Nature and\r\n                  Science.
